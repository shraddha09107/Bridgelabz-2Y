# 🚀 Bridgelabz-2415500440-Training  
### 🧠 Java Learning Log  

This repository documents my *Java learning journey* during the *Bridgelabz Training Program*.  
Each branch focuses on specific Java concepts, progressing from the basics to advanced topics like *Functional Interfaces, **Lambda Expressions, and **Exception Handling*.

## 🌿 Repository Structure  

Each branch represents a separate Java learning module:  

| Branch Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| java-core | Covers Java fundamentals — syntax, data types, loops, arrays,strings and basic logic building |
| java-oops | Focuses on Object-Oriented Programming concepts — classes, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation |
| packages-in-java | Explains how to organize Java code using packages and imports |
| wrapper-class | Demonstrates Wrapper Classes, Autoboxing, and Unboxing |
| functional-interface | Covers Functional Interfaces, Default/Static methods, and Lambda usage |
| error-and-exception | Focuses on Exception Handling, including custom and built-in exceptions |
| lambda-expression | Demonstrates real-world examples using Lambda Expressions and functional-style coding |
